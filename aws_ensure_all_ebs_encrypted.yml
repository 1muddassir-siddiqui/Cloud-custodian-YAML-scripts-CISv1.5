    CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations v1.4.0 (2.2.1).Encrypting 
    data at rest reduces the likelihood that it is unintentionally 
    exposed and can nullify the impact of disclosure if the 
    encryption remains unbroken. This policy identifies where this 
    configuration is not enabled at account level (Go to EC2 in 
    console, under account attributes click EBS encryption to find 
    the settings).
