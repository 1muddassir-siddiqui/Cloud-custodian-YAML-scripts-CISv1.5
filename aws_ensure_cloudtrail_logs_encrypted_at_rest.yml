    CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations v1.4.0 (3.7). Identify 
    cloudtrails logs that are not encrypted at rest. Configuring 
    CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS provides additional confidentiality 
    controls on log data as a given user must have S3 read  
    permission on the corresponding log bucket and must be granted 
    decrypt permission by the CMK policy.
