    Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS 
    account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic  
    requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API. One of the best ways to 
    protect your account is to not allow users to have multiple 
    access keys. This policy provides all the keys that are 
    activated for the IAM user for investigation.
