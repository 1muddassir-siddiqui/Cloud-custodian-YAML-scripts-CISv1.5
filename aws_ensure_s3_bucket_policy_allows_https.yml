  comment: |
    CIS AWS Foundations v1.4.0 (2.1.2). Identify s3 where https is 
    not enforced via bucket policy. By default, Amazon S3 allows   
    both HTTP and HTTPS requests. To achieve only allowing access to 
    Amazon S3 objects through HTTPS you also have to explicitly deny 
    access to HTTP requests. Bucket policies that allow HTTPS 
    requests without explicitly denying HTTP requests will not 
    comply with this recommendation
