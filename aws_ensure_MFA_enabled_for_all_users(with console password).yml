    CIS AWS Foundations v1.4.0 (1.10)
    Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of 
    authentication assurance beyond traditional credentials. With 
    MFA enabled, when a user signs in to the AWS console, they will 
    be prompted for their username and password as well as for an 
    authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA device. 
    It is highly recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts 
    that have a console password.
