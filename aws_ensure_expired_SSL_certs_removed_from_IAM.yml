    Removing expired SSL/TLS certificates eliminates the risk that 
    an invalid certificate will be deployed accidentally to a 
    resource such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), which can 
    damage the credibility of the application / website behind the 
    ELB. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete expired 
    certifiates. This policy identifies the expired IAM 
    Certificates.
